Hello, I'm a software engineer, and my passion is creating games and apps for mobile devices. Additionally, I enjoy staying updated on the latest technologies in mobile development, backend, and DevOps. In the future, I also plan to delve into AI and machine learning, as I believe AI will shape the world in the coming years. My ultimate goal is to become a full-stack developer and create a mobile app or game with over 5 million users worldwide.
